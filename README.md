# N-SHE-Site

This is the website I developed for my podcast, Notorious S-H-E. You can find this podcast at my website, http://notoriousshe.com/ , or on Spotify at https://open.spotify.com/show/2P8apJBMvO0Tr38uiHrN34 .

In this podcast, I interview women about their experience in different STEM roles. This website was developed by me with the aid of W3Schools. It was developed in HTML with the styling embedded.

 <p><i><b>Interviews and resources from women in STEM for future women in STEM</b></i></p>
 <p>Welcome to Notorious S-H-E, a podcast by women in STEM for future women in STEM. In this podcast, host Gaby Hall interviews women in STEM careers to expose listeners to different career options and resources. The goal of this podcast is to show young girls that anyone, regardless of their background, can be successful in their STEM careers.</p>
<p>Each episode features a lightning lesson and an interview with a successful woman in STEM. These lightning lessons are meant to explain different STEM topics and highlight careers similar to that of the interviewee. This website also features episode-specific and general resources. </p> 
<p>This podcast was developed in partnership with the Sanctuary for Independent Media’s Hudson Mowhawk radio station. The Hudson Mohawk Magazine is a locally produced news hour that provides sanctuary for the discussion of a wide range of ideas.

    <div class="w3-container">
      <h6>Hi! I’m Gaby Hall, a Cognitive Science student at <a href="https://www.rpi.edu//">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI),</a> expecting to graduate in the Spring of 2023. I’m a teaching assistant at <a href="https://albanycancode.org/">Albany Can Code</a> and an intern at <a href="https://www.mediasanctuary.org/">the Sanctuary for Independent Media’s</a> Hudson Mohawk Radio. I was inspired to develop this podcast series by my work as a speaker for the nonprofit organization, <a href="https://www.codella.org/">CODeLLA.</a> Through this organization, I have had the honor of speaking at many events advocating for women’s education rights and female involvement in STEM. I have a passion for education, computer literacy, and the youth of the STEM world. 
      </h6>
      <h6>At RPI, I’ve worked as a research assistant in the Department of Economics programming for a study on how gendered virtual assistants influence gender biases in the workplace. I also worked as a research assistant for the Manufacturing Innovation Center (MIC) at RPI. At MIC, she worked on a program on robotics education programs throughout the country. At RPI, I’m involved with numerous organizations such as the Women at Rensselaer Mentorship program and the Theta Tau chapter of the sorority Alpha Phi. Prior to RPI, I was a national honorable mention and a regional winner of the <a href="https://www.aspirations.org/">NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Award</a> for the development of my  Envirohacks high school hackathon. During this time I worked as an intern for <a href="https://learn01.io/">Learn 01</a> and as a contracted programmer for the nonprofit organization <a href="https://www.codella.org/">CODeLLA.</a>. In the future, I hope to continue my education and pursue higher degrees in cognitive science and anthropology. I also hope to be an advocate for education and digital literacy.

        <h6><b>Episode Description</b></h6>
        <h6>In this episode, we join Tia Dubuisson of Belle Fluer Technologies. She comes to talk to us about her journey, aws servers, and big data. What is big data? Big data is a term that describes large, hard-to-manage volumes of data – both structured and unstructured – that inundate businesses on a day-to-day basis. But it's not the amount of data that's important. It's what organizations do with the data that matters. Her company, Belle Fluer Technologies focuses on data, analytics & AI solutions to tansform Businessnesses. </h6>
        <h6>In this episode, Tia advises to “Stay Hungry!” One great way to do this is to get certifications. Certifications are an easy way to prove your knowledge and learn more about computer science without needing a degree. They’re also a great way to keep up-to date on skills for the ever-changing tech industry. See the resources below for places you can get certifications. </h6>
        <h6>Tia also emphasizes the importance of clear communication and diversity. Anyone developing software is subject to implicit biases (the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner). By having more diversity, we can reduce these biases and include more perspectives. Clear communication is key for a healthy and productive work environment.</h6>
        <h6>Tia wants to remind all the listeners, “If others can do it, why can’t you?”</h6>
